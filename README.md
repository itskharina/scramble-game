Users should be able to:

- Input guesses letter by letter into corresponding input boxes.
- See immediate feedback on incorrect guesses through a list of incorrect letters.
- Know how many tries (out of a maximum of 5) they have left to guess correctly.
- Restart the game at any point to try a new word.
